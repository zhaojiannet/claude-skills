description: Enforce safe PostgreSQL migration practices. Use this skill when editing **/migrations/*.sql, **/migrate/*.sql, schema.sql, or when the user mentions migration, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, ADD COLUMN, NOT NULL, RENAME COLUMN, CREATE INDEX, lock table, downtime, schema change, sqitch, golang-migrate, Flyway. Forbids destructive ops without explicit user approval, NOT NULL adds without default, blocking index creation on large tables, atomic renames, transaction-less migrations.

This skill enforces safe PostgreSQL migration practices. The rule: every migration runs on a live production database without downtime. If it cannot, **STOP** and ask first.

Apply when editing any SQL file under `migrations/` (or equivalent migration tool path). For one-off data fixes that are not for production schema, mention it explicitly so this skill knows to relax.

## Core principles

- **Always wrap in a transaction**: `BEGIN; ...; COMMIT;`. A failed step rolls back. Some migrations cannot run inside a transaction (`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE`); put these in their own migration file.
- **Idempotent guards**: `IF EXISTS` on `DROP`, `IF NOT EXISTS` on `CREATE`. A migration that fails halfway should be safe to retry.
- **No long locks during business hours**: `ALTER TABLE` that rewrites the entire table (adding a `NOT NULL` column without a default before PG 11, changing column type) takes an `AccessExclusiveLock` and blocks reads.
- **Never lose data without explicit approval**: `DROP TABLE`, `DROP COLUMN`, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE` without `WHERE`, `ALTER TYPE ... DROP VALUE` are destructive. STOP and ask the user before writing them.

## Forbidden patterns

- `DROP TABLE foo;` without `IF EXISTS` and without explicit user approval.
- `TRUNCATE foo;` without explicit user approval.
- `DELETE FROM foo;` without `WHERE`. This is functionally `TRUNCATE` and locks the table.
- `ALTER TABLE foo ADD COLUMN bar text NOT NULL;` (no default). On a non-empty table this fails. Either add with `DEFAULT` (PG 11+ is non-rewriting), or split into three migrations.
- `CREATE INDEX idx_foo ON foo(bar);` on a large production table. Use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` in its own non-transactional migration.
- `ALTER TABLE foo RENAME COLUMN old TO new;` deployed atomically with code that reads from `new`. Old code still in flight breaks. Split: add new, dual-write, switch reads, drop old.
- `ALTER TABLE foo ALTER COLUMN bar TYPE int USING bar::int;` on a large table. Same rewrite problem.
- Migration without `BEGIN; ... COMMIT;` (unless the operation cannot run in a transaction).
- Mixing data backfill (UPDATE millions of rows) with schema change in one transaction. Long-running transactions hold locks and bloat WAL.
- A new migration when an unmerged migration in the same branch already changes the same table/column. grep `migrations/` first; consolidate if found.

## Safe pattern: add NOT NULL column

Three steps:

```sql
-- migration N: add nullable
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN status text;

-- migration N+1: backfill (in batches if large)
UPDATE users SET status = 'active' WHERE status IS NULL;

-- migration N+2: set NOT NULL
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN status SET NOT NULL;
```

PG 11+ accepts a default for the add step that does not rewrite the table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN status text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active';
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN status DROP DEFAULT;  -- 仅当 default 只是为了 add
```

## Safe pattern: rename column

```sql
-- migration N: add new column, keep both, code dual-writes
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email_address text;
UPDATE users SET email_address = email;

-- migration N+1: drop old (after deploy switches reads)
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN email;
```

## Safe pattern: large index

```sql
-- 单独文件，不写 BEGIN/COMMIT
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_org_id ON users(org_id);
```

If the create is interrupted, the index is left invalid:
```sql
SELECT pg_class.relname FROM pg_class
JOIN pg_index ON pg_index.indexrelid = pg_class.oid
WHERE pg_index.indisvalid = false;
```
Then `DROP INDEX` and recreate.

## When the change is destructive

`DROP TABLE`, `DROP COLUMN`, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE` without `WHERE`, `ALTER TYPE DROP VALUE`: these can lose data. **STOP** and report:

> Migration [filename] contains [destructive op]. Confirm:
> 1. The data is no longer needed (or has been backed up).
> 2. No production code reads the column/table.
> 3. The change is rolled out after the code that stops using it.
> Approve to proceed?

## 验证（写完任何 migration grep 一遍）

```bash
grep -rnE 'DROP\s+TABLE' --include='*.sql' migrations/ 2>/dev/null | grep -vi 'IF EXISTS'
grep -rnE '^\s*TRUNCATE\b' --include='*.sql' migrations/ 2>/dev/null
grep -rnE 'DELETE\s+FROM\s+\w+\s*;' --include='*.sql' migrations/ 2>/dev/null      # DELETE 无 WHERE
grep -rnE 'ADD\s+COLUMN\s+\w+\s+\w+\s+NOT\s+NULL\s*;' --include='*.sql' migrations/ 2>/dev/null   # 无默认值
grep -rnE '^\s*CREATE\s+INDEX\s+' --include='*.sql' migrations/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v 'CONCURRENTLY'
grep -rL 'BEGIN' migrations/*.sql 2>/dev/null   # 缺事务包裹
```
